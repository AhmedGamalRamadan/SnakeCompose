# Snake Game in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose

This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose for the UI rendering.
 The game provides a nostalgic experience of controlling a snake to eat food and grow in size while avoiding the snake's own body.

## Features:
- **Jetpack Compose:** The app leverages *Jetpack Compose*, a modern Android UI toolkit, to create a seamless and interactive user experience.
- **Kotlin:** Developed entirely in *Kotlin*, the codebase benefits from the conciseness and expressiveness of the language, promoting efficient and readable code.
- **Custom Canvas Rendering:** Leveraged Canvas to create dynamic graphics and animations,enhancing the game's visual appeal.
- **Dynamic Sound Effects:** Integrated MediaPlayer to provide players with an immersive auditory experience, triggering sound effects upon game over.
- **Scoring System:** Keep track of your score as you consume food and grow the snake
- **Game Over Detection:** Detect collisions with the snake's body to end the game.
